CS324-Graphics-Assignment4
==========================

The goal for this assignment is to create a basic 3D modeling API in Java using only the Java drawLine to do the actual drawing.

Using a camera transform to view all the objects these four things are to be graphed:

1. An equation in 3D
2. A rubrics cube, both with and without spaces between the cubes.
3. The CS department hallway.
4. My name in 3D block letters.
